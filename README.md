# Earth's Peril

This is a block breaker style game, with the theme to defend :earth_asia: from :alien: invasion.

# Story

In the future, we send out a single into deeper space in search of intelligence, little we knew that this can be picked up 
by rouge Aliens looking for resources like most of the intelligent species.

They send out a recon ðŸ›¸ to investigate our resources and found the Earth's core as a rare material they call as Canratius.
This metal is super durable and rare, the aliens use this metal to build their space ships. The amazing property of this Canratius
is that only Canratius can meld or damage another Canratius. The aliens have to destroy Earth to get the metal from its core.

Good thing our Military was swift enough to take down this recon Alien and take his ship, Earth has got its defending chance against
this otherwise unstoppable enemy. The only problem is, we got just one ship to take down an entire army.

This is where you are needed solider, the Earth's future depends on you. Use the space ships Canratius ball to destroy enemy ships,
so that we can salvage them to make our own ships to stop them.
